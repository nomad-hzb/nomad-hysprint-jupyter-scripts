# Roadmap

## To Do
- [ ] Add function to have axes as angstrom for GIWAXS
- [ ] Add Function to only select range from data for fitting
- [ ] Move 'self.status_output' to the top, it shouldn't be in data loading only
- [ ] Add linear and polynomial models for background subtraction

## In Progress

## Done
- [x] Add `load_h5_data` function and make the script detect whether h5 data is available
